# MusicBar

MusicBar is an iOS runtime modifications which adds a new way to control your music. Pressing volume up on either the homescreen or within an app will present a new view allowing you to quickly view what song is playing, pause or play, and skip to the next song.

## Installation

MusicBar is in pre-release beta. BE WARNED RIGHT NOW, THERE WILL BE BUGS

Once an update for Cydia is available, this package will be on a public repo for easy installation. Electra users can find the dylib and plist here: [MusicBar.zip](https://github.com/CPDigitalDarkroom/MusicBar/releases)

## To Do

- [X] Fix MusicBar not being touchable on the HS (Thanks, Andy!)
- [] Prevent presentation when spotlight is presented
- [] Alternatively dismiss spotlight and then present for ^
- [] Fix play/pause not being as responsive as it should be
- [] Implement a better activation method than volume up
- [] Landscape support

## Why FOSS

You may have read I've stopped making paid packages and made all my previous work free. I did this for a couple reasons: a) I don't have as much time as I did to hack away, b) it was stressful to worry about pirates, c) I just want people to use my shit and ejoy it without worrying about finding cracked copies.

Jailbreaking is going through a tough spot and I think it's time to shed the bullshit. Let's have some fun shall we?
